# Faster Whisper FastAPI

üöÄ Welcome to the Faster Whisper FastAPI project! This project is designed to provide a fast and efficient implementation of the Whisper algorithm using the FastAPI framework.

## Getting Started

üîç To get started with the Faster Whisper FastAPI project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/frankwongWO/faster-whisper-fastapi.git
```

# colab

# command

run

# After a day of trial and error, I finally solved the issue!

For anyone having a problem, copy all DLLs from CUDNN, as well as cublasLt64_11.dll from the GPU Computing Toolkit into your ctranslate2 package directory. Since I'm using a venv, it was \faster-whisper\venv\Lib\site-packages\ctranslate2", but if you use Conda or just regular Python without virtual environments, it'll be different.

# check cuda version

```
nvcc -V
```
