# Faster Whisper FastAPI

üöÄ Welcome to the Faster Whisper FastAPI project! This project is designed to provide a fast and efficient implementation of the Whisper algorithm using the FastAPI framework.

## Getting Started

üîç To get started with the Faster Whisper FastAPI project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/frankwongWO/faster-whisper-fastapi.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the FastAPI server using the following command:
```
uvicorn run:app --reload --port 8123
```
4. Open the API documentation in your web browser using the following URL:
http://localhost:8123/docs

# Installation
Before using Faster Whisper FastAPI, you need to install CUDA and cuDNN. Here are the installation instructions:

## Install CUDA
You can download the CUDA installer from the NVIDIA website. Here are the steps:

Go to the following link to download the CUDA installer:

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exe_local

Run the CUDA installer and follow the instructions in the installation wizard.

## Install cuDNN
You can download the cuDNN files from the NVIDIA website. Here are the steps:

Go to the following link to download the cuDNN files:

https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Extract the cuDNN files to a directory.

## Troubleshooting

For anyone having a problem, copy all DLLs from CUDNN, as well as cublasLt64_11.dll from the GPU Computing Toolkit into your ctranslate2 package directory. Since I'm using a venv, it was \faster-whisper\venv\Lib\site-packages\ctranslate2", but if you use Conda or just regular Python without virtual environments, it'll be different.

## Check the CUDA version. Run the following command in the command line:
```
nvcc -V
```
